## Part 2. Problems 

### Problem 1. Personal Data 

#### a. Data Summarizing

The data can be summarized by comparing the distribution of water consumption (liters) between cardiovascular and strength training workouts using a box plot that visually represents the distribution and spread of the data, showing the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum, with the underlying data displayed as jitter points. This comparison is informative for me because I typically associate cardiovascular workouts with being more physically demanding and sweat-intensive, potentially leading to greater water intake than strength training sessions, so I expect that water consumption will be higher on days I run or bike compared to when I lift weights.  


#### b. Visualization
```{r Personal Data Visualization}

ggplot(data = data, # calling in data frame
       aes(x = Workout_Type, # assigning the categorical predictor variable to the x-axis
           y = Water_Consumption, # assigning the response variable to the y-axis
           fill = Workout_Type)) +  # fill color for boxes
  
 # first layer: boxplot 
   geom_boxplot(color = "black") + # outline color (black)

# second layer: jitter points of raw data   
  geom_jitter(height = 0, # making sure the jitter points don't move along y-axis
              width = 0.15, # narrowing the width of the jitter points
              alpha = 0.6, # making slightly transparent in case of overlap 
              shape = 21, # changing the shape of the points
              aes(fill = Workout_Type, # fill color for the points
                  color = Workout_Type)) +  # outline color for the points
  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12), # adjusting title size
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8), # adjusting subtitle size
        legend.position = "none", # removing the legend
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"), # changing the background color
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = NA), # removing the color from the grid lines 
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = NA), # removing the color from the grid lines 
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black")) +  # adding back the y and x axis lines   
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cardiovascular" = "darkorchid1", 
                               "strength" = "deepskyblue")) + # changing the fill of the boxplots 
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("cardiovascular" = "yellow",
                                "strength" = "red")) +  # changing the outline color of the jitter points
  
  labs(title = "How Water Intake Compares to the Type of Workout",  # setting title
       subtitle = "By Ethan Mathews", # adding a subtitle
       x = "Workout Type",  # cleaning the x-axis label
       y = "Water Consumed (liters)")   # cleaning the y-axis label


```


#### c. Caption 
**Figure 1. Cardiovascular workouts are associated with higher water intake.** Data from *Personal study conducted for Data Science in Environmental Studies* (Mathews, E. 2025). Water consumption (liters) was recorded for two types of workouts, cardiovascular (n = 11) and strength training (n = 22). Cardiovascular workouts had a higher median and a more narrow spread of water intake compared to strength training. Transparent open circles represent individual observations and the box plots represent the distribution of values for each group. Colors represent the workout type (purple = cardiovascular and blue = strength training).

### Problem 2. Affective visualization

#### a. What an Affective Visual Looks Like 
When I first thought about affective data visualization, I was drawn to the idea of humanizing data—transforming numbers on a spreadsheet into something more tangible and relatable. For my project, I plan to represent average water intake by illustrating body parts like back, arms, chest, legs, abs, and shoulders along the x-axis. Instead of traditional bars or box plots, each muscle group will be visually represented and "filled" with water to reflect the average amount consumed during workouts targeting that area. To complement this, a small flame icon above each body part will indicate average workout intensity, with four levels/rings that represent the level of intensity for that body part (more rings filled = higher average intensity). This approach personalizes the data, highlighting the physical connection between hydration and strain while making the visualization emotionally engaging and easy to interpret.


#### b. Sketch of Idea 
The sketch is a rough estimate and are not the correct values for the average water intake and intensity level. This will be done in the draft.

#### c. Draft of Visualization 
```{r}

data_summary <- data |> # starting data frame creating new summary data frame 
  clean_names() |>  # cleaning the names to standardize format 
  select(water_consumption, intensity, body_part_trained) |> # selecting necessary columns 
  mutate( 
    intensity_score = case_when( # creating a new numeric column based on the intensity level
      intensity == "low" ~ 1,
      intensity == "medium" ~ 2,
      intensity == "hard" ~ 3,
      intensity == "extreme" ~ 4, # associating the levels with numerical values so I can calculate the average
      TRUE ~ NA_real_)) |>  # if it doesn't match any label it will assign it NA
  
  group_by(body_part_trained) |> # grouping the body parts together to calculate averages
  summarize( 
    avg_water = mean(water_consumption, na.rm = TRUE), # calculating the mean of the water consumed by the different body parts 
    avg_intensity = mean(intensity_score, na.rm = TRUE), # calculating the average intensity by the different body parts 
    n = n())


```

#### d. Artist Statement 
The content of my piece:
This piece visualizes my personal data collected over the past weeks, showing the average amount of water I consumed relative to the body part I trained, alongside the intensity of each workout. By humanizing the data through illustrated muscle groups and symbolic flame icons, the visualization makes the information more engaging and accessible than reviewing raw notes or spreadsheets.

The influences:
The inspiration came from the lecture examples, particularly the violin plots, which sparked the idea of representing each muscle group as a visual shape. From there, I developed the concept of filling each body part with a water level to reflect hydration while layering in flame icons to communicate workout intensity in an emotionally resonant way.

The form of your work:
The piece is a digital drawing that combines artistic illustration with data-informed storytelling, allowing for customized body part silhouettes enhanced with color and symbolic elements to convey both quantitative (water intake) and qualitative (intensity) data. This format offers a clear, expressive, and adaptable way to represent personal metrics that can be reused as a fun way to track future trends.

The process:
I was initially confronted with a creative block and I needed to take a step back to reexamine my data not just as numbers but as a reflection of physical effort, leading me to abandon traditional charting and instead visualize the body as a site of intensity. This reframing allowed me to design an illustration where hydration and exertion are mapped directly onto the body, transforming abstract data into something spatial and personal. 


### Problem 3. Statistical Critique

#### a. Revisit and Summarize
To address their main research question, whether newer groundwater wells are being drilled deeper than older wells in response to declining water tables, the authors use Spearman’s rank correlation. This non-parametric test evaluates the relationship between well construction year (predictor) and well depth (response) across ~39 million wells in 40 countries. A significant positive Spearman ρ indicates that newer wells tend to be deeper, suggesting adaptation to groundwater decline, while a non-significant or negative correlation implies limited or no adaptive response. This approach allows the authors to assess whether well construction practices are keeping pace with groundwater depletion over space and time

![Global groundwater wells at risk of running dry](StatisticalCritiqueFigure.jpg)


#### b. Visual Clarity
The authors effectively visualize their statistical results in Figure 2, using a clear layout where the x-axis lists countries and the primary y-axis shows the fraction of spatial areas with well-deepening trends (Spearman ρ > 0). A secondary y-axis on the right interprets whether well-deepening or shallowing trends are more common. The figure also includes a time period color key that distinguishes five intervals, enabling comparison of trends over time, though it summarizes model output rather than displaying raw data or uncertainty measures like standard error.
